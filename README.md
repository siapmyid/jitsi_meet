## Getting Started

### Android
Jitsi Meet's SDK AndroidManifest.xml will conflict with your project, namely 
the applicatoin:label field. To counter that, go into 
`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the tools library
and `tools:replace="android:label"` to the application tag.

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="yourpackage.com"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"> <!-- Add this -->
    <application 
        tools:replace="android:label"  
        android:name="your.application.name"
        android:label="My Application"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
```

### Code

```dart
_joinMeeting() async {
    try {
      var options = JitsiMeetingOptions()
        ..room = "myroom" // Required, spaces will be trimmed
        ..subject = "Meeting with Sandhy Sanjaya"
        ..userDisplayName = "My Name"
        ..userEmail = "myemail@email.com"
        ..audioOnly = true
        ..audioMuted = true
        ..videoMuted = true;

      await JitsiMeet.joinMeeting(options);
    } catch (error) {
      debugPrint("error: $error");
    }
  }
```
